I am giving a heads up that the deployment will happen next week.
We need to wrap up the call in the interest of time.  Or  We need to wind up the call in the interest of time
We are at the top of the hour and need to wrap up the call.
Since we began working on this application, we have been experiencing the similar kind of challenges

High:
------
"I would like to walk you through this screen
  I could say that we will complete this deployment.
"I would say we need this deployment."
  "I would say we might not complete this deployment." 


Medium:
------
I sent an email to the prospective client to discuss our services and explore potential collaboration opportunities.
I will share the profit amount proportionately.
I tried a couple of times, and Ravi also made a few attempts, but we couldn't get it done,
 so I'm going to roll it over to the next sprint. 
 In the meantime, please take PCA out of your mind while celebrating the festival,
 as we still have our sprint commitments to focus on.

We need to cut over to the new database system by the end of the month
We have quite a few items to complete the Sprint.(This implies you have a significant number of items.)
This allows the consumer to resume processing from where it left off, even if it was restarted.
We will start working on it from where we left off.
I noticed how efficient the tool was in improving productivity, and this is what prompted me to get this for our team.
This loan was already in flight when the new regulations were implemented, so the process continued under the previous guidelines."
Here's a sentence using "dispositioning the application":

"We are in the process of dispositioning the application"తుది నిర్ణయం తీసుకోవడం" లేదా "గమ్యం నిర్ణయించడం" to determine whether it should be archived, upgraded, or retired based on its current performance and business value."

Since some of the work is still in flight due to competing priorities and conflicting directions,
we will need to carry over a few stories to the next sprint. With all that being said, I remain optimistic,
but I don’t want to portray things as simple, as accomplishing this will entail a Herculean effort.
Please tone down any distractions, like PCA, and   on our sprint commitments. 
I need you to weigh in from your standpoint, drill down into the details, and consider a rifle effect approach to meet compliance. 
We have quite a few things to cover, but we'll move along with a sense of urgency, ensuring we stay versatile and tailored to the needs at hand.
